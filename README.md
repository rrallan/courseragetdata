# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

The main script, "run_analysis.R", does:

1. Loads and merges the training and test datasets
2. Get only the mean and standard deviation data
3. merges all the data into one set
4. Loads activity and subject labels and data
5. Creates a tidy dataset that contains the average of each
   column for the subjects and activities.
6. Writes the tidy data set to the file "tidy.txt".

The codebook, "codebook.md", describes the data and what needed to be done.

The "tidy.txt" file shows the final course project output.
